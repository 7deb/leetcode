# Leetcode Clone

In this project me and my friend are making leetcode clone to learn full stack development 

We are going to implement this using MERN stack using MongoDB for the database
express node as the backend server and react as the frontend library 





## Deployment

To deploy this project in your system first clone the repository 

Then run the following commands 

```bash
  cd ./leetcode 

  npm install 
```

to start the backend server
```bash
  npm start server 
```
You will also have to setup the environmental variables in a .env file 

which should contain a PORT_NUMBER

A mongoDB connection string 

A JWT_SECRET
